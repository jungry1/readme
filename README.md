## harita.hacettepe.edu.tr
It is a project in which the map web-service of Hacettepe University is shared openly.

First, I downloaded the codes via https://github.com/banbar/harita.hacettepe.edu.tr.

# Requirements for running the Hacettepe Campus project:
-PostgreSql 
-Node.js
-Visual Studio Code

I transferred the SQL code to the postgresql software with the restore command (database: hacettepecampus). I then connected the postgis and qgis apps. In this way, I transferred the postgis layers to qgis.

After installing the libraries, I connected to the server platform. To use the NPM module, we need to install the node.js application. We connect to localhost by entering our own postgresql host information in the db part of the code.

Then, using the same commands on the client, we connect to the frontend (Hacettepe campus).


## BOUNDING BOX IN QGIS 
In QGIS, a bounding box refers to a rectangular area that defines the spatial extent of a geographic feature or a set of features. It is represented by four coordinates: the minimum and maximum values for both the x-axis (longitude or easting) and the y-axis (latitude or northing). 

First, we install the lat lon tools and bounding box plugins from the plugin section of qgis. Then we enter the BBOX Capture section from the lat lon tools > settings section. Here we enter the projection as our format (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax). After completing the process, we receive the coordinate information.

Then we create a new postgresql table. In this table we enter the boundingbox coordinates. Here we choose the numeric data type to enter the coordinates because our coordinates are decimal numbers. We will update this information in the code in the next stages.

Before pulling the code in Postgresql, you need to update your localhost information from the db.js section.

I updated the code with the app.get command to pull the table in Postgresql.

The ChangeView component is a custom component that takes care of changing the map view based on different scenarios. It receives center, zoom, bounds, and selectedBuilding as props and uses the useMap hook from react-leaflet to access the map instance. Inside the useEffect hook, it checks for different conditions and updates the map view accordingly. The MapComponent component is the main component that renders the map. It receives routeGeometry, userLat, userLng, and selectedBuilding as props. The center and zoom variables define the initial center and zoom level of the map. The routePositions variable maps the routeGeometry array to convert each coordinate from [longitude, latitude] format to [latitude, longitude] format. The campusBounds variable defines the latitude and longitude data of the lower right and upper left points of the bounding box that will be added to the map. The bounds variable uses the L.latLngBounds function from Leaflet to create a bounds object based on the routePositions and campusBounds. This bounds object is used to fit the map view to the specified bounds. The startPosition and endPosition variables store the first and last positions of the routePositions array, respectively. The startIcon, endIcon, currentLocationIcon, and binaIcon variables define custom icons for the markers on the map. Inside the return statement, the MapContainer component from react-leaflet is used to render the map. It receives the center and zoom props, as well as a style prop for setting the width and height of the map. The ChangeView component is rendered as a child of MapContainer, passing the necessary props. The TileLayer component renders the tile layer of the map using a URL from OpenStreetMap. If routePositions has at least one position, a Polyline component is rendered to draw the route on the map.
